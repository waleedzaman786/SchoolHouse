        <h3>Information you provide us directly:</h3>
        <p>We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a Little Children 
           Schoolhouse account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in 
           User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your username 
           and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.

        <h3>Information we may receive from third parties:</h3>
        <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example,
            through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Little Children Schoolhouse application, linking your account to the Little Children Schoolhouse Service,
            etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Little Children Schoolhouse. This information could include, but is not limited to,
            the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the
            third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs,
            and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well 
            as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Little Children Schoolhouse. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party
            websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Little Children Schoolhouse Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by 
            adjusting your settings on the third party service.

        <h3>Inviting a friend to use Little Children Schoolhouse:</h3>
        <p>Little Children Schoolhouse may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service. If you choose to use our invitation
            service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact
            list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by 
            inviting a friend to Little Children Schoolhouse through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing
            your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email
            or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.

        <h3>Finding your friends on the Service:</h3>
        <p>Little Children Schoolhouse may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with Little Children Schoolhouse accounts through a “Find friends” 
            feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through
            a search of names and usernames on Little Children Schoolhouse. If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide Little Children Schoolhouse access
            to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using Little Children Schoolhouse. 
            If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy 
            policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or 
            username appears on our Service. Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not 
            use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on Little Children Schoolhouse.

            such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile 
            device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by 
            Little Children Schoolhouse. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in
            faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

        <h3>Ads on Little Children Schoolhouse:</h3>
        <p>We may also share certain information such as your location, browser, and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that
            may be of interest to you. Little Children Schoolhouse may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology
            to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies

            For example, Google uses DART cookies in order to deliver ads to you through the Service. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Service
            and previous websites that you may have visited. Other advertising networks also use similar cookies, clear gifs, or other mechanisms to deliver targeted advertising to you through the Service. You can delete
            these cookies by following the instructions here: http://www.Little Children Schoolhouse.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cookies . You may opt out of use of Google’s DART cookie and cookies placed by 
        Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) certified ad networks here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp . </p>
        <p>Opting out of these cookies will be effective not only on the Service, but on all 
          websites with NAI certified advertising networks. However, these opt-outs will be ineffective on networks that are not NAI certified.
          Please note that an advertiser may ask Little Children Schoolhouse to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Little Children Schoolhouse
          or our Partners determines the target audience and Little Children Schoolhouse serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser
          or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
          To enhance your user experience or help us improve and measure our effectiveness, Little Children Schoolhouse may embed code from third parties on the Service. Examples of such parties may include 
          Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google, YouTube, Howcast, VideoJug, AOL, and others. These third parties may collect information about you including IP address, cookies in ways Little Children Schoolhouse does not control.
